# Master-Thesis
This is the repository for the project of my master thesis. The aim of this work was a conceptual replication of a study of [Srinivasan et al. (2016)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/16/4434?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JNeurosci_TrendMD_0). In this course, I implemeted a MVPA, which is a supervised classification problem on fMRI data, using python based software. The scripts contained in this repository comprise a notebook for the extraction of labels for the machine to learn from the log-files of the experiment, a notebook for the main analysis pipeline and a notebook for the visualisation of results.
The versions of the notebooks are outdated and will be updated as soon as I have access to my computer again which will be at the begining of october.
